## Hands-on Lab: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, i extracted some stock data, and display this data in a graph. The goal was to practice data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned stock and revenue data
- Removed formatting symbols (like `$`, `,`, and spaces) from the revenue column
- Converted date columns to datetime format
- Filtered data to focus on dates up to June 2021
- Visualized the stock prices and revenues over time using subplots

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
